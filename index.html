              As a full-stack developer, I played a pivotal role in leading both frontend and backend
              development, overseeing the project's progress to ensure its successful realization.
              This cutting-edge project utilizes a diverse technology stack, incorporating JavaScript,
              HTML, CSS, C#, and the React framework for the frontend, along with Dotnet Core for the
              backend.

              Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges, particularly in
              establishing a reliable peer-to-peer connection between users. The implementation of
              real-time notifications, messages, and order invitations posed a novel experience for me as

              an effective and efficient solution for the platform.

              Throughout the development journey, we encountered several challenges, notably in
